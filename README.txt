THIS CODE IS BAD, PLEASE DO NOT USE OTHER THAN FOR LEARNING PURPOSES.

For those who are not just knowledgable about buffer overflows and whatnot, but are
willing to show me if there is unsecure code running, I'd actually be really
happy if you would point out what I'm doing wrong (unsecure code, bad coding practices, etc).
I want to get into the security field so debugging my own code should make things easier to work with, I hope.
